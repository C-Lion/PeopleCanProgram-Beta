// LESSON NAME: Draw a point.
// This line of code is a comment.
// Comments don't do anything, they just make a program easier to read and understand.

// Create a Point object.
var p = new Point();
// Set the x-coordinate of p.
p.x = 100;
// Define y-coordinate of p.
p.y = 50;
// Draw point p.
p.draw();
// Lesson is complete and correct :)
